abstract = {In real-world manufacturing environments, the execution of a schedule often encounters uncertain events, which will bring the risks of performance deterioration and production system instability. This study addresses the optimization of risks both in performance and stability for the job shop scheduling under random machine breakdowns, in which three objectives: makespan, makespan risk and stability risk are considered at the same time. The buffering approach under the limited predictive makespan will be proposed and used to generate predictive schedules, which allows inserting additional idle time to control the risks. By utilizing the available information about the relationship between the risks and the random machine breakdowns, we have developed two kinds of operation-block based buffering strategies. In order to meet the decision makers with different risk preferences, a multi-objective predictive scheduling algorithm with the proposed buffering strategies is developed to generate a Pareto solution set. Extensive experimental results indicate that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can provide a better Pareto solution set in terms of both the diversity and the convergence.}

abstract = {In this paper, the train scheduling problem is modelled as a blocking parallel-machine job shop scheduling (BPMJSS) problem. In the model, trains, single-track sections and multiple-track sections, respectively, are synonymous with jobs, single machines and parallel machines, and an operation is regarded as the movement/traversal of a train across a section. Due to the lack of buffer space, the real-life case should consider blocking or hold-while-wait constraints, which means that a track section cannot release and must hold the train until next section on the routing becomes available. Based on literature review and our analysis, it is very hard to find a feasible complete schedule directly for BPMJSS problems. Firstly, a parallel-machine job-shop-scheduling (PMJSS) problem is solved by an improved shifting bottleneck procedure (SBP) algorithm without considering blocking conditions. Inspired by the proposed SBP algorithm, feasibility satisfaction procedure (FSP) algorithm is developed to solve and analyse the BPMJSS problem, by an alternative graph model that is an extension of the classical disjunctive graph models. The proposed algorithms have been implemented and validated using real-world data from Queensland Rail. Sensitivity analysis has been applied by considering train length, upgrading track sections, increasing train speed and changing bottleneck sections. The outcomes show that the proposed methodology would be a very useful tool for the real-life train scheduling problems.}

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of determining energy efficient schedules in a flexible job shop. The goal is to minimize the total energy cost, given a time-of-use pricing scheme, while ensuring that the schedule does not violate a maximum makespan. The problem is first formalized as a mixed integer program. Because it is already difficult to solve, the simpler problem with a fixed sequence of operations is then extensively studied. Some properties are derived for the specific problem with a fixed sequence. These properties show that the complexity of the problem depends on the structure of the energy pricing scheme. They are also used to propose two heuristic approaches. Relying on these heuristics, we further develop an iterative tabu search for the general problem. Extensive computational experiments are carried out to evaluate the solution methods and the potential gains on the total energy cost, depending on the flexibility associated to the maximum allowed makespan and on the time-of-use structures.}

In this perspective, the setting of the fourth industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, seeks to make technological development sustainable with the crucial aim of resource saving firstly. Starting by this issue, this study aims at introducing a smart tool, based on the application of a mathematical model, already proposed in literature, for the job scheduling from an energy saving perspective into a real company IT system. After a preliminary introduction on the concepts of sustainability and industry 4.0, and how they are connected to each other, and a second part that will deal with Smart Factory, smart factories oriented to customization and flexibility, the mathematical model of activity scheduling will be discussed and than applied to a specific IT system. This model, in fact, properly implemented into a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) will represent a powerful tool oriented to the efficient use of energy resources.}

abstract = {This paper investigates a dynamic scheduling problem within a job shop robotic cell, wherein multiple robotic arms are responsible for material handling in a U-shaped arrangement. Each robotic arm has access to specific workstations based on their distance in the cell layout. Therefore, a part may need to be exchanged between several robots according to its process plan. For this purpose, intermediate buffers are positioned between each pair of consecutive robots. Due to the dynamic nature of the problem, new jobs arrive at unpredictable times, which in turn necessitates rescheduling taking the system’s current state into account. To tackle this problem, firstly, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is devised. Secondly, three distinct Speed-up Constraints (SCs) derived from the problem’s inherent characteristics are designed and implemented to accelerate the MILP model’s solving procedure. Afterward, the problem is formulated using Constraint Programming (CP) approach. The performance of the CP model and the MILP model in presence of all possible combinations of the SCs are evaluated and compared through solving various random instances. Next, an analysis is performed on the buffers’ pick-up criterion and how it is affected by the problem’s size. Besides, the impact of changes in the robots’ speed on the productivity of the cell is assessed. Finally, the extent to which the rescheduling priority affects the output of the model is studied.}

In order to solve this problem, we propose four mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models as well as a constraint programming (CP) model, among which four MILP models are formulated based on four different modeling ideas. MILP models are effective in solving small-scaled problems to optimality. DFJSP is NP-hard, therefore, we propose an efficient constraint programming (CP) model based on interval decision variables and domain filtering algorithms. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed MILP models and CP model. The results show that the sequence-based MILP model is the most efficient one, and the proposed CP model is effective in finding good quality solutions for the both the small-sized and large-sized instances. The CP model incomparably outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and obtains new best solutions for 11 benchmark problems. Moreover, the best MILP model and CP model have proved the optimality of 62 best-known solutions.}

Local search techniques are the most common form of hybridization that can be used to enhance the performance of these algorithms. Agent-based systems technology has generated lots of excitement in recent years because of its promise as a new paradigm for conceptualizing, designing, and implementing software systems. This paper presents an agent-based local search genetic algorithm for solving the job shop scheduling problem.

The job shop scheduling problem (JSP) is a traditional problem largely exploited in the operational research area through the academic research but belonging also to the domain of practical situations, especially in industrial companies. Several approaches have been used to investigate this problem that is very complex when addressing real industrial cases. The JSP is a NP-hard problem and no exact solution can be obtained in polynomial time. Meta-heuristics approaches when solving scheduling problems have proven to be very effective and useful in practical situations. Among them, Tabu Search (TS) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) have been used to solve optimization problems with success. The main reason is that these algorithms have good performance in terms of solution quality and execution time, when compared with optimization or simple heuristics techniques respectively. In this sense, the multi-agent approach proposed in this paper combining these algorithms brings new perspective to solve this kind of problem. In this paper a multi-agent approach based on A-Team that combines TS and GA and other specific agents is presented to solve the JSP. Results for benchmark problems from the literature are presented aiming to demonstrate the applicability of the proposal.}

abstract = {Owing to the increasing complexity of products and the specialization of enterprises, production outsourcing has become a common practice in industrial manufacturing. Moreover, different jobs feature various priorities in actual production. The previous research that aims to minimize the makespan may not be applicable in real scenarios. Therefore, this study investigates a flexible job shop scheduling problem with outsourcing operations and job priority constraints. We propose a sequence-based mathematical model aiming at minimizing weighted overdue days, which considers the outsourcing constraints and different overdue weights of jobs with different priorities. An efficient hybrid self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm with heuristic strategies (HSDE) is proposed to address this problem. In HSDE, a well-designed chromosome encoding and decoding method is presented. To eliminate individuals that do not satisfy the outsourcing constraints, we add a penalty term to improve the objective function. By considering heuristic strategies for initial chromosome generation, the proposed approach is able to achieve a high-quality initial population. Crossover and mutation operators with self-adaptive control of the parameters are established to enlarge the search range and accelerate the convergence speed. Finally, several experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms both in efficiency and accuracy.}

abstract = {Due to the influence of dynamic changes in the manufacturing environment, a single dispatching rule (SDR) cannot consistently attain better results than other rules for dynamic scheduling problems. Dynamic selection of the most appropriate rule from several SDRs based on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) offers better scheduling performance than using an individual SDR. However, the discreteness of action space caused by the DQN and the simplicity of the action as an SDR limit the selection range and restrict performance improvement. Thus, in this paper, we propose a scheduling method based on deep reinforcement learning for the dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling problem (DFJSP), aiming to minimize the mean tardiness. Firstly, a Markov decision process with composite scheduling action is provided to elaborate the flexible job-shop dynamic scheduling process and transform the DFJSP into an RL task. Subsequently, a composite scheduling action aggregated by SDRs and continuous weight variables is designed to provide a continuous rule space and SDR weight selection. Moreover, a reward function related to mean tardiness performance criteria is designed such that maximizing the cumulative reward is equivalent to minimizing the mean tardiness. Finally, a policy network with states as inputs and weights as outputs is constructed to generate the scheduling decision at each decision point. Also, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is used to train the policy network to select the most appropriate weights at each decision point, thereby aggregating the SDRs into a better rule. Results from numerical experiments reveal that the proposed scheduling method achieves significantly better scheduling results than an SDR and the DQN-based method in dynamically changeable manufacturing environments.}

Although DRL method is effective for solving JSSP, there are still deficiencies in state representation, action space definition, and reward function design, which make it difficult for the agent to learn effective policy. In this paper, we model JSSP as a Markov decision process (MDP) and design a new state representation using the state features of bidirectional scheduling, which can not only enable the agent to capture more effective state information, improve its decision-making ability, but also effectively avoid the phenomenon of multiple optimal action selections in candidate action set. Invalid action masking (IAM) technique is employed to narrow the search space, which helps the agent avoid exploring suboptimal solutions. We evaluate the performance of the policy model on eight public test datasets: ABZ, FT, ORB, YN, SWV, LA, TA, and DMU. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method on the whole has better optimization ability than the existing state-of-the-art models and priority dispatching rules.}
